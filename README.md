# Lambda_xray

We’re going to be creating a Lambda function that can be called via a Function URL, that will query a Dog photo API, it will then save the image to an S3 bucket, and then show us the image in the browser.

The Dog API we’re using is: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

We will set up Lambda X-Ray to view where in the code there might be bottlenecks or errors.
